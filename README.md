# BananaCleaningDirector
Title page: BananaCleaningDirector Report, Team Name:BillCollectors, Authors:Maxim Rao, Stefan Prodanovic, Samir El Mehtedi, Taj Mailei

**1. Introduction - MAXIM
Provide a description of the topic, including what the program will do and what the users can expect.**
Our given topic was Banana, Cleaning and Director. So we decided to create a game that involved a Banana character, who has to clean various parts of the screen in a given amout of time. The program will be a fun and interactive game for the player. The user can expect to use his mouse to click and intercat with elements on the screen, intercating with these elemtents will add to the score, which will them cause the game to end.

****3. User Stories and Requirements - MAXIM
-Maxim- The user controls a banana shaped character who has to clean areas of the screen. The way this will be done is through the user, who has to click on various "dirty" parts of the screen. This will add to the score, and if the score is reached within a set amount of time a "Success" screen will come up, and the another key will be pressed to restart the game. 
The acceptance tests for this will be, 
1: To have a charcter that resembles a banana, 
2: For the player to be able to clikc and "clean" dirty parts of the screen,
3: For a score counter to accuractly store the amount of spots cleaned,
4: A working timer that ends, 
5: A success screen which can restart the game:

-Stefan- User Story:
The user controls a banana-shaped janitor who must rapidly remove gum stuck to desks in a chaotic school hallway. The user clicks on gum blobs while avoiding getting stuck themselves.
Acceptance Tests: 
1:A banana character is visible and movable along the hallway.
2:Gum blobs randomly appear and can be clicked to be removed.
3:If the banana steps on gum without cleaning it first, the character is slowed for 3 seconds.
4:Each gum blob cleaned adds 1 point to the score counter.
5:A success screen appears when 15 gum blobs are cleaned within 60 seconds, with an option to restart the level.

- Taj- User Story:
The user controls a banana in a luxury hotel, tasked with cleaning mirrors without leaving streaks. The player clicks and drags over smudges to polish them before time runs out.
Acceptance Tests:
The banana character appears in front of a mirror-filled background.
Smudges on mirrors can be cleaned by clicking and dragging over them.
A cleaning streak appears and disappears when a smudge is fully cleaned.
A meter shows progress toward a fully cleaned mirror.
A timer counts down from 45 seconds, and a success screen appears when all mirrors are clean.

-Samir-User Story:
The user controls a banana who must mop up colourful drink spills in a food court. Players must react quickly, clicking on the newest spills before they spread too far.
Acceptance Tests:
The banana character is visible in a mall food court setting.
Random spills of different colours appear over time.
Clicking on a spill within 5 seconds cleans it and adds to the score.
If left too long, the spill spreads and becomes uncleanable, reducing the banana’s health.
The game ends when 3 spills are missed, triggering a failure screen with an option to try again.

List all user stories and requirements and their acceptance criteria. Make sure that these are clear and specific.


4. Design and Architecture - TAJ
Include a graphical representation of the architecture of your program, illustrating how its primary components relate to each other. You may omit certain details to ensure clarity in the diagram. It is meant to give an overview.**
**Explain, your diagram, and include a key/legend.





6. Testing User Acceptance Tests - MAXIM - TAJ
14 comp1050
– Define test cases for user stories and requirements that your team decided to test as part of user acceptance testing. Ensure that these tests cover the most important aspects of the two programs.
– List the user stories and requirements that were the source for the user acceptance tests.
– Include a table that gives an overview of the acceptance tests and tells whether they passed or
failed. System Tests
– Include a table that lists the system tests, that weren’t acceptance tests. These are tests that run the entire program, and are executed by the team to test features they added themselves.
– Include in that table the outcome for each system test, including an overview of the test and whether it passed or failed.
Unit **Tests**
*– Select at least four sub-components of your animation.
– Include a table of lists for each component of their unit tests. Include the test inputs, the expected
output/outcome, and whether the test failed or passed.



7. Coding Guidelines Define the coding guidelines your team adhered to during the project. This should include any specific standards or practices that have been be used to ensure the quality and consistency of the code.

8. Software Quality - SAMER - TAJ
• Include a table that lists all warnings that the Comp1050 Checker PMD in the GitHub Actions tab raises for your project.
• List which issues you fixed since week 11. Give a brief rationale for fixing the issue.



9. Project Management -SAMER**
List the tasks and issues on your project board. State with who was been assigned to each job. Explain who was responsible for reviewing the tasks before they were moved to the "Done" column and which methods was used for code review. Note, that reviewing a tas****k, and reviewing code, can be two separate activities.


10. User Manual Provide a detailed user manual that describes how to interact with your animation. - MAXIM

    
11.  Ethics - STEFAN**
• List all external sources for code, design, or other artefacts th**at you have used in your program.
• List all tools that you have used beyond Processing, Git, GitHub, and word processing tools in your
project. For both programming and the creation of documenta**tion.
• Include any other acknowledgement of contributors beyond your team or teaching staff, i.e. anyone
who was not on your team or a tutor or lecturer, who helped you nevertheless.
